## Description :seedling:

With cute plantomos that users can collect through taking picture of plants, users would be more aware of their natural surroundings, resulting in higher appetite to learn about the nature. With quest system, users are incentivized to go outdoors, which enhances both mental and physical health. We let students on our campus try out our app and fill out a survey afterward (around 30 people). Around 80% of the students agree with the statement “The app makes me want to take picture of plants”, while almost all of the students agreed that “The graphic and plantomo designs would attract me to download the app.” Furthermore, around 90% of the students agree that “I would read about the plant so I can gain rewards for my plantomos”. 60% of the students agreed with the statement “I am more willing to go outdoors because of the app”.
